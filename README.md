# PasswordFailure
  This python script is used to detect if others tring to use your PC.    
  If someone enters wrong password his/her photo will be saved to your files.    
  Run the script only once. If you run that more then once you may face with some problems.
```bash
python3 password_failure.py
```
  You can see saved photos in `/media/thief`    
  And if you want to delete them you must be sudoer!
